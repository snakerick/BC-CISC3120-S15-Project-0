        <h1>Project Zero</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>The main objective of this project is to allow you to
            become familiar with the GitHub+Eclipse workflow you'll be
            using on later projects. It will also give you a little bit
            of practice writing code in Eclipse, and also get you
            started reading the Java API.</p>


        <h2>The Project</h2>


        <p>
            In class, we've talked a couple times about a very simple
            application that uses the
            <code>Scanner</code>
            class to read two numbers from the keyboard and print the
            sum to the screen. Implement this application, but with one
            small twist: let the user silently decide whether to enter
            numbers as integers or floating-point numbers (eg as
            <code>int</code>
            or as
            <code>double</code>
            ). Calculate the sum depending on the type of the user's
            entry. Here are two example runs (user's text in <font
                color="red">red</font>):
        </p>

        <pre>
Enter two numbers: <font color="red">4 5</font>
The sum of 4 and 5 is 9.

Enter two numbers: <font color="red">4.2 5.45</font>
The sum of 4.2 and 5.45 is 9.65.
</pre>

        <p>
            Note that you should <em>not</em> ask the user what type
            they're going to use. How should your program work if the
            user enters
            <code>5</code>
            and
            <code>17.3</code>
            ? You should also deal gracefully (no ugly exception
            messages!) with the situation in which the user's input is
            not numerical.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will certainly need to read the Java API documentation
            on the
            <code>Scanner</code>
            class. You may not understand everything you read: that's
            fine. Look for what you <em>do</em> understand and use that
            to solve the problem.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>Doing More / Extra Credit</h2>
        If you get this done really quickly and want to do more, see if
        you can add the ability for your program to read and write numbers
        as <em>words</em>. That is, let the user enter values as
        <code>one</code>
        <code>two</code>
        , and so on (you may want to limit your 'vocabulary' to the
        single digits), and provide output in the same way.


        <h2>Submission and Grading</h2>

        Normally, I grade projects based on documentation, style,
        design, and correctness. (We'll talk more about this in class.)
        This is just a "starter," so the main emphasis is getting <em>something</em>
        done. Specifically:


        <p>I will grade out of 100 points, allocated as follows:</p>

        <ol>
            
                <p>
                    <li><b>50% Completion</b> Even if you have
                        trouble getting this to work, or generating all
                        the documentation, push <em>something</em> up to
                        GitHub before the project is due. If you have
                        trouble doing this, let me know <strong>as
                            soon as possible</strong>.
                             </li>
                </p>
           
            <p>
                <li><b>25% Documentation</b>. Your project should include
                three kinds of documentation, as described in the <a
                    href="http://bc-cisc3120-s15.github.io/documentation.html">About
                    Documentation</a> page. You should provide doccomments
                for each class and method in your project, and generate
                HTML documentation using javadoc. For this project, the
                <code>README</code>
                needs only to contain a "Works Cited" section: Any
                website, book, or similar resource from which you get
                useful guidance must be listed here, along with a brief
                description of what you got from it (a bit of code? an
                explanation? an answer to a question?). You do not need
                to list the Java API or either of the two books
                required/recommended for class. If you use no other
                resources, then your "Works Cited" section must simply
                contain the word <em>None</em>.</li>
            </p>
            


            <p><li>
                    <b>25% Correctness</b> Does your program work as it
                    should?
                </p></li>

        </ol>



        <h3>A Note on Style</h3>

        Usually, part of your grade depends on the <em>style</em> of
        your code. Here's what I expect: Your code should be properly
        formatted, with enough (but not too much) whitespace. Eclipse
        will do most of this for you; make sure you let it help you.
        Variable names, metohd names, etc, should all be
        "self-documenting" but not excessively long (one-letter
        variables names should <em>only</em> be used as loop counters).
        <em>Generally</em>, you can use any style you like, as long as
        you're consistent. If you're not sure what style to use, follow
        the <a
            href="https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html">Google
            Style Guide</a>, except where Eclipse's automatic formatting
        contradicts these guidelines.
        </li>

        <p>
            You can earn up to 10 points extra credit by implementing
            extra behaviors. Any extra behaviors you provide should be
            listed briefly in the
            <code>README.md</code>
        </p>

        <p>
            As with Project 1, on this project, you are to work strictly
            <em>on your own</em>. Specifically, you may neither show
            your code to, nor look at the code of, anyone else taking
            3120 this semester. You may consult online/textbook
            resources (subject to the "Documentation" requirements
            above). You may certainly consult with me. You may, if you
            like, discuss your design at a high level with other
            students ("Oh, I found the
            <code>java.foo.bar</code>
            package to be really helpful," or, "Sure, I can explain the
            geometry of a paint window to you.").
